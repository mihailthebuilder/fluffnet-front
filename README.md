# Fluffnet frontend

## Todos

- set up github pages
  - make sure the requestUrl gets updated accordingly
- if image too big, make it smaller
  - tried a quick implementation with [compressorjs](https://github.com/fengyuanchen/compressorjs/) but the model then generated bad results, not sure why
- consider making stricter image size requirements
